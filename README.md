**Throw vs Throws**


Before you can catch an exception, some code somewhere must throw one. Any code can throw an exception: your code, code from a package written by someone else such as the packages that come with the Java platform, or the Java runtime environment. Regardless of what throws the exception, it's always thrown with the throw statement.

All methods use the throw statement to throw an exception. The throw statement requires a single argument: a throwable object.
